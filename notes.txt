React (Links to an external site.) is an open-source, declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces
React works especially well for maximizing the performance of large applications that can benefit from reusable UI components, \
Rather than build a starter project from scratch, we’ll use the Create React App (CRA) CLI to bootstrap the application.
To create a new react app run the following: photo-port is name of app
npx create-react-app photo-port
Did you notice that we used npx instead of npm? This package runner tool simplifies the installation and running process of devDependencies. 
Rather than installing CRA and then running it, npx will try using the local installation. If it's not there, npx will install it for you.
Now navigate into that newly created directory and run npm start. You should see something like the following image in your browser:

If this feature annoys you, you can turn it off by adding the BROWSER=none option to the npm start script.

 CRA uses webpack to bundle up and run a development server that restarts when files are changed. 
 Additionally, it uses Babel to transpile ES6 to ES5.
 You may be familiar with compiling, which is when high-level code like C++ is transformed into a lower-level language, 
 like machine code. Well, with transpiling, we're doing something similar.we're transforming languages with similar levels of abstraction. 
 This means that developers can leverage new versions of 
 JavaScript without losing functionality if the user's browser doesn't support the latest JavaScript.

 The react package defines new React components.
 The react-dom package serves as the entry point to the DOM to render the JSX by using the virtual DOM.
 But you should know that React will inject the whole app into whichever element has the root id.
 Think of App.js as the root component, or the wrapper component that houses all of the other components.
 Inside the function, it seems that HTML is all that's returned. But actually, it's not HTML; it's a language called JSX that can represent HTML in JavaScript.
 To do so, we need to call the class attribute className, as follows, because class is already a keyword in JavaScript.
 Then, in the About section, add an <img /> element with the src attribute of {coverImage}. You can use the {} syntax in JSX to use JavaScript. 
 We could choose to hardcode all of the categories, but that would lead to less DRY code. 
 Instead, we'll use the .map() function inside a JSX expression.
 Whenever we map over anything in JSX, the outermost element must have a key attribute that's set to be something unique.
 Often the key will be an id.
 When you map over an array in a JSX expression, you should return only 
 a single JSX element—like how you can only return a single element from a React component.
 e'll use the built-in onClick() method.
