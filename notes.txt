React (Links to an external site.) is an open-source, declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces
React works especially well for maximizing the performance of large applications that can benefit from reusable UI components, \
Rather than build a starter project from scratch, weâ€™ll use the Create React App (CRA) CLI to bootstrap the application.
To create a new react app run the following: photo-port is name of app
npx create-react-app photo-port
Did you notice that we used npx instead of npm? This package runner tool simplifies the installation and running process of devDependencies. 
Rather than installing CRA and then running it, npx will try using the local installation. If it's not there, npx will install it for you.
Now navigate into that newly created directory and run npm start. You should see something like the following image in your browser:

If this feature annoys you, you can turn it off by adding the BROWSER=none option to the npm start script.

 CRA uses webpack to bundle up and run a development server that restarts when files are changed. 
 Additionally, it uses Babel to transpile ES6 to ES5.
 You may be familiar with compiling, which is when high-level code like C++ is transformed into a lower-level language, 
 like machine code. Well, with transpiling, we're doing something similar.we're transforming languages with similar levels of abstraction. 
 This means that developers can leverage new versions of 
 JavaScript without losing functionality if the user's browser doesn't support the latest JavaScript.

 The react package defines new React components.
 The react-dom package serves as the entry point to the DOM to render the JSX by using the virtual DOM.
 But you should know that React will inject the whole app into whichever element has the root id.
